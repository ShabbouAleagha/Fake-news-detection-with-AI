              "'Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently remarked that if he loses the 2024 election it will “be a bloodbath for the country.”The Onionexamines what he might have meant by the statement. Pretty straightforward, honestly. Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing with a sharp, blood-stained knife can often get messy. At least he came right out and said it. Awwwww! Look at that little droopy face! Look at it! No need to panic. Trump doesn’t plan on committing violence against anyone other than his loved ones. When Trump hosted the popular reality television program, he famously referenced the bloodshed of his enemies and called immigrants animals. What you interpreted when you heard him predict a bloodbath says more about you than about Trump. He was merely holding up a mirror to your subconscious. The rally caught him in a moment of panic after using the restroom. Although the ‘bloodbath’ comments sound alarming out of context, Trump was simply threatening to personally lock the doors of the Ford plant with everyone inside and light it on fire. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter what Trump said—it only matters how he made you feel. Trump was referring to the fact that if he is not elected in November, Democrats will set up special booths in Chili’s where only bald men can sit and talk about bald things. Looks like he’s having one of his episodes. Better tie him down so he doesn’t hurt himself. Due to Trump’s propensity to deliver speeches in the more literary Old Church Slavonic, subpar translators often take creative liberties. The threat of violence is not conditional—it’s assured! Losing the election means he’ll have even more time to play, which could cause the lines between reality andGrand Theft Autoto blur even more. In order to elicit sympathy, Trump was trying to say that if he lost, he was going to slit his wrists in the tub for real this time. Trump is a massive fan of Opeth, Katatonia, and Paradise Lost, so when you put their members together? That’s a match made in hell. If Biden emerges victorious in 2024, Trump has threatened to wear his vampire dentures and bite Democrats’ necks. Trump’s allies said he was extremely nervous that Biden would trip, fall, and accidentally break something if he wasn’t careful. On day one of his second term, Trump has vowed to order every single one of his supporters to converge on Red Cross headquarters and donate several liters of blood. He’s keeping a gigantic blue marlin alive in a tank to drown his sorrows with should the election not go his way. All the stress of losing would calcify small stones in his ureter and cause him to pee blood. This is exactly what happened last time Melania let him watch it. He keeps trying to clarify this, but the media keeps spreading lies and calling it a gaffe. Run.'"

              "'House Republicans are preparing to sign articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and walk them across the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate as soon as this week. That will make Mayorkas the first cabinet official to beformally impeached in 150 years. But what happens next is far from certain. Only one thing is for sure: it\\'s going to get messy. Democrats control the Senate and almost certainly will vote to acquit Mayorkas, arguing that the articles of impeachment against him are deeply flawed and based on Republican objections to the Biden Administration’s immigration policy—not on any alleged high crimes and misdemeanors. The question is, how long will the process drag out? Both parties have procedural tools at their disposal. The top Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer,toldreporters April 9that he thought he had the votes to rapidly close up the impeachment proceedings in the Senate. “We’re going to try and resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Impeachment should never be used to settle policy disagreements,” Schumer said outside the Senate floor. The Constitution gives the Senate “the sole Power to try all Impeachments” and requires two-thirds of Senators to convict. That means that the House has been given right to accuse and the Senate has the right to acquit or convict. But the actual proceedings of an impeachment trial aren’t listed in the founding document and instead have been largely set by historic precedent. That gives Democrats in the Senate some leeway in determining what happens once they receive the articles. Read More:Mayorkas Is Only the Second Cabinet Member to be Impeached. The First Was a Civil War Hero Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah are concerned that Schumer will put forward a motion to table the articles of impeachment by majority vote, without a Senate trial. They are demanding that Schumer move forward with a Senate trial of Mayorkas, they wrote in theWall StreetJournalon April 7. Democrats “want to avoid an uncomfortable election-year discussion about President Biden’s biggest failure: the U.S. southern border invasion,” Cruz and Lee wrote. Cruz and Lee alsopoint out that Republicans went forward with a trial when they were in the majority during the first impeachment of Donald Trump in 2020 over whether he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Senate Republicans voted to acquit him—and Trump was tried andacquitted againin a second impeachment trial over his role in inciting theJan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.  For the Jan. 6 impeachment charges in 2021, Cruz and Lee voted with 43 other Senate Republicans to dismiss them, but that wasn’t enough votes to table the House charges and the trial went forward anyway. Now, a group of Republicans are planning to delay Schumer’s ability to close up impeachment proceedings with speeches demanding a full trial and forcing time-consuming votes on points of order. Legal experts havetoldTIME that the articles of impeachment against Mayorkas are very weak, lack evidence of wrongdoing, and don’t rise to the standard set in the Constitution. The impeachment articles charge Mayorkas with \"willfully and systematically\" refusing to comply with federal immigration laws during a surge in migrants crossing the border in recent months and say he obstructed the House Republican investigation into his handling of the border and \"breached the public trust\" by telling Congress that the U.S.-Mexico border is secure. Read More:Experts Blast Mayorkas Impeachment Probe for Lack of Evidence The border is at the center of an election-year fight. The number of illegal border crossings has increased in recent years. The Biden Administration has asked Republicans in Congress to approve more funding to hire Border Patrol agents and immigration officers, but Republicans have refused, saying that they want Biden to be more restrictive with the resources he has. The effort to impeach Mayorkas in the Housefailed twicebefore ultimately passing in February. Evensome House Republicans felt thatimpeaching Mayorkaswent too far. “It’s completely unconstitutional,” Rep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, said Nov. 15, during a broadcast of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM. “Impeachment is a very limited power to remove officials for, quote, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,” McClintock said. When House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February, Biden said in a statement that “history will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games”—a statement White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre echoed on April 9. Throughout the impeachment process, Mayorkas has denied any wrongdoing.After the House voted to impeach him, Mayorkas toldCNNon Feb. 17 that the impeachment allegations are “baseless allegations, no basis in fact, no basis in law, and I continue my work.”'"
